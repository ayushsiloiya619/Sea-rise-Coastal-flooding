# Sea_Coastal_Real_Time_Analysis
Sea Level Rise Data &amp; Coastal Flooding Data.

1. The code begins by importing the `requests` library, which is used to send HTTP requests to the server and retrieve data.

2. An API token is set for the NOAA API, which will be used for authentication when making requests to the NOAA API.

3. The `base_url` variable is set to the base URL for station queries in the NOAA API.

4. The request headers are set with the API token using a dictionary named `headers`.

5. The code enters a try-except block to handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the execution.

6. Two station IDs are defined: `sea_level_rise_station_id` and `coastal_flooding_station_id`, representing specific stations for sea level rise and coastal flooding data.

7. The URLs for sea level rise and coastal flooding data are constructed by appending the station IDs to the `base_url`.

8. The code sends a GET request to the NOAA API to fetch the sea level rise data using the `requests.get()` function. The API token is included in the request headers.

9. The response from the API is obtained and converted to a JSON format using the `response.json()` method.

10. Specific data fields from the sea level rise data are extracted and stored in variables for further use.

11. The sea level rise data is printed, displaying the values of the extracted fields.

12. The code sends another GET request to the NOAA API to fetch the coastal flooding data using the `requests.get()` function, similar to the previous step.

13. The response from the API is obtained and converted to JSON format.

14. Specific data fields from the coastal flooding data are extracted and stored in variables.

15. The coastal flooding data is printed, displaying the values of the extracted fields.

16. If any exceptions occur during the execution of the code, they will be caught in the except block, and an error message will be printed.

To summarize, this code fetches data related to sea level rise and coastal flooding from the NOAA API by making HTTP requests using the `requests` library. The data is then extracted and printed to display specific fields such as elevation, dates, latitude, longitude, etc.
